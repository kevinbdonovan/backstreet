Backstreet is back, alright?

This was a project i did for college, kinda failed in what i wanted it to do, whilst it doesn't look the best, I was using it to try and link to APIs and use some bits I never used before (pulling from an XML file etc)

It's far from perfect, but I'm leaving it here just so I can look back
