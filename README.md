# backstreet
Backstreet is back, alright?

So this is a group project I did with two other guys, both of whom did very little in terms of code.

It has alot to improve on, and one day I will return to it, I wrote all the CSS myself which im proud of, but like i said,
I need my skills to improve if i want to be at the level I can.

This is my learning curve, whilst im not 100% proud of this, it'll hopefully show in future how far ive come, and if im honest I did
learn alot from this.

Peace out!
Kevin
